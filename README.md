## Credits
+ Limeplayer started as a fork of ctrmus, meaning that the majority of its code came from, is based off, or was built on top of ctrmus.

+ Deltabeard: For his work on ctrmus which was the original foundation for this application.

+ Astronautlevel & Liquidfernir (and the Anemone3DS team): For their work on Anemone3DS which helped quite a bit when it came to starting with citro2d graphics, and they were very helpful in general.

+ Others: If I forgot to mention someone important (as in their code is used without credit), please let me know.

+ Most of the icons under gfx are from the site [icons8.com](https://icons8.com) and are licensed under the [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)

## Special Thanks
+ Smealum, WinterMute, Fincs, and the Devkitpro team: For making/maintaining documentation and libraries for libctru and citro2d/3d which were very helpfull when making this project.

+ The Easyrpg Team: For inspiring this application with their work porting wildmidi to the 3ds and the switch (the reason I started working on this was because I wondered if there was a midi player for the 3ds).

+ Family: For providing me helpfull feedback, and testing pre-release versions.
